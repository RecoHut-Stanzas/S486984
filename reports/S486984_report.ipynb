        "\n",
        "Few things in life are certain; most things are driven by chance. Whenever we cheer for our favorite sports team, or purchase a lottery ticket, or make an investment in the stock market, we hope for some particular outcome, but that outcome cannot ever be guaranteed. Randomness permeates our day-to-day experiences. Fortunately, that randomness can still be mitigated and controlled. We know that some unpredictable events occur more rarely than others and that certain decisions carry less uncertainty than other much-riskier choices. Driving to work in a car is safer than riding a motorcycle. Investing part of your savings in a retirement account is safer than betting it all on a single hand of blackjack. We can intrinsically sense these trade-offs in certainty because even the most unpredictable systems still show some predictable behaviors. These behaviors have been rigorously studied¬†using¬†*probability theory*. Probability theory is an inherently complex branch of math. However, aspects of the theory can be understood without knowing the mathematical underpinnings. In fact, difficult probability problems can be solved in Python without needing to know a single math equation. Such an equation-free approach to probability requires a baseline understanding of what mathematicians call¬†a¬†*sample space*.\n",

        "\n",
        "Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection and interpretation of numeric data. It is the precursor of all modern data science. The term¬†*statistic*¬†originally signified ‚Äúthe science of the state‚Äù because statistical methods were first developed to analyze the data of state governments. Since ancient times, government agencies have gathered data pertaining to their populace. That data would be used to levy taxes and organize large military campaigns. Hence, critical state decisions depended on the quality of data. Poor record keeping could lead to potentially disastrous results. That is why state bureaucrats were very concerned by any random fluctuations in their records. Probability theory eventually tamed these fluctuations, making the randomness interpretable. Ever since then, statistics and probability theory have been closely intertwined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistics and probability theory are closely related, but in some ways, they are very different. Probability theory studies random processes over a potentially infinite number of measurements. It is not bound by real-world limitations. This allows us to model the behavior of a coin by imagining millions of coin flips. In real life, flipping a coin millions of times is a pointlessly time-consuming endeavor. Surely we can sacrifice some data instead of flipping coins all day and night. Statisticians acknowledge these constraints placed on us by the data-gathering process. Real-world data collection is costly and time consuming. Every data point carries a price. We cannot survey a country‚Äôs population without employing government officials. We cannot test our online ads without paying for every ad that‚Äôs clicked. Thus, the size of our final dataset usually depends on the size of our initial budget. If the budget is constrained, then the data will also be constrained. This trade-off between data and resourcing lies at the heart of modern statistics. Statistics help us understand exactly how much data is sufficient to draw insights and make impactful decisions. The purpose of statistics is to find meaning in data even when that data is limited in size.\n",

Now, what is the probability of seeing 240 tails in 840 flips with a biased coin of 3 head to 1 tail ratio? It sounds simple to calculate now, isn't it? It will be `stats.binom.pmf(240, 840, .25)`.

Every weekday, between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., Fred will purchase 3,000 ads aimed at hungry locals. Every ad will be viewed by a single Brisbane resident. The text of every ad will read, ‚ÄúHungry?

For example, 100 people view a blue ad, and another 100 people view a green ad. These numbers add up to 3,000 views that are distributed across the 30 colors. Fred‚Äôs advertising software automatically tracks all daily views. It also records the daily clicks associated with each of the 30 colors. The software stores this data in a table. That table holds the clicks per day and views per day for every specified color. Each table row maps a color to the views and clicks for all analyzed days.\n",

Or should hamsters, cats, and dogs be assigned three separate clusters of their own? If so, perhaps we should consider clustering pets by breed. Thus, Chihuahuas and Great Danes fall into diverging clusters. Differentiating between dog breeds will not be easy. However, we can easily distinguish between Chihuahuas and Great Danes based on breed size. Maybe we should compromise: we‚Äôll cluster on both fluffiness and size, thus bypassing the distinction between the Cairn Terrier and the similar-looking Norwich Terrier.\n",

        "Is the compromise worth it? It depends on our data science task. Suppose we work for a pet food company, and our aim is to estimate demand for dog food, cat food, and lizard food. Under these conditions, we must distinguish between fluffy dogs, fluffy cats, and scaly lizards. However, we won‚Äôt need to resolve differences between separate dog breeds. Alternatively, imagine an analyst at a vet‚Äôs office who‚Äôs trying to group pet patients by their breed. This second task requires a much more granular level of group resolution.\n",

        "\n",
        "People have relied on location information since before the dawn of recorded history. Cave dwellers once carved maps of hunting routes into mammoth tusks. Such maps evolved as civilizations flourished. The ancient Babylonians fully mapped the borders of their vast empire. Much later, in 3000 BC, Greek scholars improved cartography using mathematical innovations. The Greeks discovered that the Earth was round and accurately computed the planet‚Äôs circumference. Greek mathematicians laid the groundwork for measuring distances across the Earth‚Äôs curved surface. Such measurements required the creation of a geographic coordinate system: a rudimentary system based on latitude and longitude was introduced in 2000 BC.\n",

        "Data observation‚ÄîA sailor recorded a series of observations including wind direction, the position of the stars, and (after approximately AD 1300) the northward direction of a compass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematical and algorithmic analysis of data‚ÄîA navigator analyzed all of the data to estimate the ship‚Äôs position. Sometimes the analysis required trigonometric calculations. More commonly, the navigator consulted a series of rule-based measurement charts. By algorithmically adhering to the rules in the charts, the navigator could figure out the ship‚Äôs coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualizing and decision making‚ÄîThe captain examined the computed location on a map relative to the expected destination. Then the captain would give orders to adjust the ship‚Äôs orientation based on the visualized results.\n",

        "This navigation paradigm perfectly encapsulates the standard data science process. As data scientists, we are offered raw observations. We algorithmically analyze that data. Then, we visualize the results to make critical decisions. Thus, data science and location analysis are linked. That link has only grown stronger through the centuries. Today, countless corporations analyze locations in ways the ancient Greeks could never have imagined. Hedge funds study satellite photos of farmlands to make bets on the global soybean market.

Connection analysis can lead to untold riches, but it can also save countless lives. Tracking the connections between proteins in cancer cells can generate drug targets that will wipe out that cancer. Analyzing connections between suspected terrorists can uncover and prevent devious plots.

Engineers prefer to use the term¬†*network*, while mathematicians prefer¬†*graph*. For our intents and purposes, we‚Äôll use the two terms interchangeably. Graphs are simple abstractions that capture the complexity of our entangled, interconnected world. Properties of graphs remain surprisingly consistent across systems in society and nature. Graph theory is a framework for mathematically tracking these consistencies. It combines ideas from diverse branches of mathematics, including probability theory and matrix analysis. These ideas can be used to gain useful real-world insights ranging from search engine page rankings to social circle clustering, so some knowledge of graph theory is indispensable to doing good data science.\n",

Our social networks are also flowing with activity as gossip, rumors, and cultural memes spread across tight circles of close friends. Understanding this dynamic flow can help uncover friend groups in an automated manner. Understanding the flow can also help us identify the most heavily trafficked web pages on the internet.

The¬†`Friendships`¬†table has just two columns:¬†`Friend A`¬†and¬†`Friend B`. These columns contain profile IDs that map to the¬†`Profile_ID`¬†columns of the¬†`Profiles`¬†and¬†`Observations`¬†tables. Each row corresponds to a pair of FriendHook friends. For instance, the first row contains IDs¬†`b8bc075e54b9`¬†and¬†`49194b3720b6`. From these IDs, we can infer that the associated students have an established FriendHook connection. Using the IDs, we can look up the profile of each student. The profiles then allow us to explore whether the friends share the same major or reside together in the same dorm.\n",

        "FriendHook is a popular social networking app designed for college campuses. Students can connect as friends in the FriendHook network. A recommendation engine emails users weekly with new friend suggestions based on their existing connections; students can ignore these recommendations, or they can send out friend requests. We have been provided with one week‚Äôs worth of data pertaining to friend recommendations and student responses. That data is stored in the friendhook/Observations.csv file. We‚Äôre provided with two additional files: friendhook/Profiles.csv and friendhook/Friendships.csv, containing user profile information and the friendship graph, respectively. The user profiles have been encrypted to protect student privacy. Our goal is to build a model that predicts user behavior in response to the friend recommendations. We will do so by following these steps:\n",
